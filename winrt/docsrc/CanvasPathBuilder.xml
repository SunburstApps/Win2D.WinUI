          Paths consist of zero or more figures, where a figure is made up of straight or curved segments. Figures can be opened or closed.

        <example>
                <p>The following is an example of how to create a simple CanvasGeometry using a CanvasPathBuilder object.</p>
                <code>
		    CanvasPathBuilder pathBuilder = new CanvasPathBuilder(device);
		    
		    pathBuilder.BeginFigure(1, 1);
		    pathBuilder.AddLine(300, 300);
		    pathBuilder.AddLine(1, 300);
		    pathBuilder.EndFigure(CanvasFigureLoop.Closed);
		    
		    CanvasGeometry triangleGeometry = CanvasGeometry.CreatePath(pathBuilder);

        <remarks>
        <p>
        To determine whether a point is considered filled by the path, draw a ray from that point 
        to some point obviously outside the path. Then examine the places where a segment of the path crosses the ray. 
        </p>

        Count how many segments that the ray crosses. If it's an odd number, the point is considered filled by the

        Add one for every clockwise intersection. Subtract one for every counterclockwise intersection. 
        If the result is nonzero, the point is considered inside the fill area. A zero count means that the point lies outside the fill or clip area.

        <summary>Adds a single arc to the path, specified by start and end points through which an ellipse will be fitted.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <p>
            This overload defines an arc by connecting the current path position to the specified end point.
            It computes an ellipse with the specified radius and rotation angle, positions it such that the ellipse
            passes through both points, and outputs the portion of the ellipse that lies between the two points.
            The sweepDirection and arcSize parameters disambiguate which ellipse to choose in cases where there
            is more than one possible solution.

      <summary>Adds a single arc to the path, specified as a portion of an ellipse.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          This overload defines an arc by first specifying an ellipse (center point and radius) and then
          choosing which portion of the ellipse the arc should cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          The startAngle parameter specifies where on the ellipse the arc should begin.
          This is measured in radians, clockwise from the positive x axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sweepAngle parameter specifies the size of the arc. This is measured in radians,
          clockwise relative to the startAngle. Negative sweepAngle values produce a counterclockwise
          arc. If sweepAngle is &lt;= -2&#960; or &gt;= 2&#960;, the arc becomes a complete ellipse.
          Sweep values greater than this range are clamped to one full revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the current path position is not the same as the point on the ellipse where the arc
          will begin, these will be automatically connected using a straight line.
        </p>
        <p>
          See the <see cref="M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasPathBuilder.AddArc(System.Numerics.Vector2,System.Single,System.Single,System.Single,Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasSweepDirection,Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasArcSize)"/>
          overload for an alternative way to specify arcs, which is more complicated but offers extra
          abilities such as the option to rotate the ellipse.
