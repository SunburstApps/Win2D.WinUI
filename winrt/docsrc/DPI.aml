      <para>
        This article explains the difference between physical pixels and device 
        independent pixels (DIPs), and how DPI (dots per inch) is handled in Win2D.
      </para>
      <para>
        Win2D is designed in such a way that many apps can ignore this distinction, as it 
        provides sensible default behaviors that will do the right thing when run on both 
        low and high DPI devices. If your app has more specialized needs, or if you have 
        a different opinion about what "sensible default" means, read on for the gory 
        details...

      <title>What is DPI?</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          DPI stands for "dots per inch". This is an approximate measure of the pixel 
          density of an output display such as a computer monitor or phone screen. The 
          higher the DPI, the more, smaller dots make up the display.
        </para>
        <para>
          DPI is only an approximate measure because not all display hardware can be 
          relied on to report accurate information. Some computer monitors do not report 
          DPI to the operating system at all, or the user may have configured their 
          system to render using a different DPI from the actual hardware (for instance 
          to change the size of UI text elements). Applications can use DPI to choose how 
          large things should be drawn, but should not rely on it as an exact physical 
          measurement of the display size.
        </para>
        <para>
          A DPI value of 96 is considered to be a neutral default.
        </para>

      <title>What is a pixel?</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          A pixel is a single colored dot. Images in computer graphics are made up of 
          many pixels arranged in a two dimensional grid. You can think of pixels as the 
          atoms out of which all images are built.
        </para>
        <para>
          The physical size of a pixel can vary greatly from one display to another. When 
          a computer is connected to a large but low resolution monitor or external 
          display, pixels can be quite large, but on a phone with a 1080p display only a 
          few inches across, pixels are tiny.
        </para>
        <para>
          In Win2D, whenever you see an API that specifies a position or size using 
          integer data types (or a struct such as BitmapSize that contains integers), 
          this means the API is operating in pixel units.
        </para>
        <para>
          Most Win2D APIs work with DIPs rather than pixels.
        </para>
      </content>

    <section>
      <title>What is a DIP?</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          DIP stands for "device independent pixel". This is a virtualized unit that may 
          be the same as, larger, or smaller than a physical pixel.
        </para>
        <para>
          The ratio between pixels and DIPs is determined by DPI:
        </para>
        <code>
          pixels = dips * dpi / 96
        </code>
        <para>
          When DPI is 96, pixels and DIPs are the same. When using higher DPI, a single 
          DIP may correspond to more than one pixel (or parts of pixels in the common 
          case where DPI is not an exact multiple of 96).
        </para>
        <para>
          Most Windows Runtime APIs, including Win2D, use DIPs rather than pixels. This 
          has the advantage of keeping graphics approximately the same physical size no 
          matter what display an app is run on. For instance if an app specifies that a 
          button is 100 DIPs wide, when run on a high DPI device such as a phone or 4k 
          monitor this button will automatically scale to be more than 100 pixels in 
          width, so it remains a sensible size that is possible for the user to click on. 
          If the button size was specified in pixels, on the other hand, it would appear 
          ridiculously small on this kind of high DPI display, so the app would have to 
          do more work to adjust layouts differently for each kind of screen.
        </para>
        <para>
          In Win2D, whenever you see an API that specifies a position or size using 
          floating point data types (or structs such as Vector2 or Size that contain 
          floating point values), this means the API is operating in DIPs.
        </para>
        <para>
          To convert between DIPs and pixels, use the methods
          <codeEntityReference>M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasResourceCreatorWithDpi.ConvertDipsToPixels(System.Single,Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDpiRounding)</codeEntityReference> and
          <codeEntityReference>M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasResourceCreatorWithDpi.ConvertPixelsToDips(System.Int32)</codeEntityReference>.

      <title>Win2D resources that have DPI</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          All Win2D resources that contain a bitmap image also have an associated DPI property:
        </para>
        <list class="bullet">
          <listItem><codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasBitmap</codeEntityReference></listItem>
          <listItem><codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasRenderTarget</codeEntityReference></listItem>
          <listItem><codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasSwapChain</codeEntityReference></listItem>
          <listItem><codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasControl</codeEntityReference></listItem>
          <listItem><codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasVirtualControl</codeEntityReference></listItem>
          <listItem><codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasAnimatedControl</codeEntityReference></listItem>
          <listItem><codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasImageSource</codeEntityReference></listItem>
        </list>
        <para>
          All other resource types are independent of DPI. For instance a single 
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDevice</codeEntityReference> 
          instance can be used to draw to controls or rendertargets of many different 
          DPIs, therefore the device has no DPI of its own.
        </para>
        <para>
          Similarly, <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasCommandList</codeEntityReference> 
          does not have a DPI, because it contains vector drawing instructions rather 
          than a bitmap image. DPI only comes into play during the rasterization process, 
          when the command list is drawn to a rendertarget or control (which do have DPI).
        </para>
      </content>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Control DPI</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          The Win2D controls (<codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasControl</codeEntityReference>,
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasVirtualControl</codeEntityReference>
          and <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasAnimatedControl</codeEntityReference>) 
          automatically use the same DPI as the display the app is running on. This 
          matches the coordinate system used by XAML, CoreWindow, and other Windows 
          Runtime APIs.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the DPI changes (for instance if the app is moved to a different display), 
          the control will raise the CreateResources event and pass a
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.CanvasCreateResourcesReason</codeEntityReference> of
          <codeEntityReference>F:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.CanvasCreateResourcesReason.DpiChanged</codeEntityReference>.
          Apps should respond to this event by recreating any resources (such as 
          rendertargets) that depend on the DPI of the control.
        </para>
      </content>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Rendertarget DPI</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          Things that can be drawn onto (which includes not just 
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasRenderTarget</codeEntityReference> 
          but also the rendertarget-like types 
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasSwapChain</codeEntityReference> and
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasImageSource</codeEntityReference>) 
          have a DPI of their own, but unlike the controls these types are not directly 
          connected to a display, so Win2D cannot automatically determine what the DPI 
          should be. If you are drawing to a rendertarget which will later be copied to 
          the screen, you probably want that rendertarget to use the same DPI as the 
          screen, but if you are drawing for some other purpose (eg. generating images 
          for upload to a website) a default 96 DPI would be more appropriate.
        </para>
        <para>
          To make both these usage patterns easy, Win2D provides two types of constructor 
          overload:
        </para>
        <code>
          CanvasRenderTarget(ICanvasResourceCreator, width, height, dpi)
          CanvasRenderTarget(ICanvasResourceCreatorWithDpi, width, height)
        </code>
        <para>
          The <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasResourceCreator</codeEntityReference> 
          interface is implemented by CanvasDevice as well as the Win2D controls. Because 
          a device does not have any specific DPI of its own, you must explicitly specify 
          the DPI when creating a rendertarget from one. For instance to create a default 
          DPI rendertarget where DIPs and pixels will always be the same thing:
        </para>
        <code language="cs">
          const float defaultDpi = 96;
          var rtWithFixedDpi = new CanvasRenderTarget(canvasDevice, width, height, defaultDpi);
        </code>
        <para>
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasResourceCreatorWithDpi</codeEntityReference> 
          extends ICanvasResourceCreator by adding a DPI property. This interface is 
          implemented by the Win2D controls, and makes it easy to create a rendertarget 
          which will automatically inherit the same DPI as the control it was created 
          from:
        </para>
        <code language="cs">
          var rtWithSameDpiAsDisplay = new CanvasRenderTarget(canvasControl, width, height);
        </code>
      </content>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Bitmap DPI</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasBitmap</codeEntityReference>, 
          unlike a rendertarget, does not automatically inherit DPI from a control. The 
          methods for creating and loading bitmaps include overloads to explicitly 
          specify DPI, but if you leave this out, bitmap DPI defaults to 96 regardless of 
          the current display configuration.
        </para>
        <para>
          The reason bitmaps are different to other types is that they are a source of 
          input data, rather than an output which will be drawn onto. So the important 
          thing for bitmaps is not the DPI of where that output will end up, but the DPI 
          of the source image, which is entirely unrelated to the current display 
          settings.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you load say a 100x100 default DPI bitmap and then draw it onto a 
          rendertarget, the bitmap will be scaled from 100 DIPs at 96 DPI (which is 100 
          pixels) to 100 DIPs at the DPI of the destination rendertarget (which could be 
          a larger number of pixels if it is a high DPI rendertarget). The resulting 
          image will always be 100 DIPs in size (so there will be no unpleasant layout 
          surprises), but it may suffer some blurring if a low DPI source bitmap was 
          scaled up to a higher DPI destination.
        </para>
        <para>
          For maximum clarity at high DPI, some applications may wish to provide multiple 
          sets of bitmap images at different resolutions, and at load time select 
          whichever version most closely matches the DPI of the destination control. 
          Other apps may prefer to ship only high DPI bitmaps, and let Win2D scale these 
          down when running on lower DPI displays (scaling down can often look better 
          than scaling up). In either case, the bitmap DPI can be specified as a 
          parameter to <codeEntityReference>M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync(Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasResourceCreator,System.String,System.Single)</codeEntityReference>.
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that some bitmap file formats contain DPI metadata of their own, but Win2D 
          ignores this since it is often set incorrectly. Instead, DPI must be explicitly 
          specified when loading the bitmap.
        </para>
      </content>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>CanvasDrawingSession DPI</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession</codeEntityReference> 
          inherits its DPI from whatever control, rendertarget, swapchain, etc, it is 
          drawing onto.
        </para>
        <para>
          By default, all drawing operations operate in DIPs. If you prefer to work in 
          pixels, this can be changed via the 
          <codeEntityReference>P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession.Units</codeEntityReference> 
          property.
        </para>
      </content>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Effect DPI</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          The image effect pipeline inherits its DPI from whatever 
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession</codeEntityReference> 
          an effect is being drawn onto. Internally, effect processing always 
          operates in pixels. Parameter values such as sizes or positions are specified 
          in DIPs, but these units are converted to pixels before any actual image 
          manipulation takes place.
        </para>
        <para>
          When a bitmap of different DPI than the target drawing session is used as an 
          effect source image, an internal 
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Effects.DpiCompensationEffect</codeEntityReference> 
          is automatically inserted in between the bitmap and the effect. This 
          scales the bitmap to match the target DPI, which is usually what 
          you want. If it's not what you want, you can insert your own instance of 
          <codeEntityReference>T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Effects.DpiCompensationEffect</codeEntityReference> 
          to customize the behavior.
        </para>

      <title>Composition DPI</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          The Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Composition APIs operate at a lower level than 
          Win2D XAML controls, so they do not attempt to automatically handle DPI on your 
          behalf. It is up to you to decide what units you prefer to operate in, and set 
          whatever transforms are necessary to achieve that as part of your composition 
          visual tree.
        </para>
        <para>
          Windows.UI.Composition APIs such as CreateDrawingSurface always specify sizes 
          in pixel units. When using Win2D to draw onto a composition surface, you can 
          specify whatever DPI you want to use when calling 
          <codeEntityReference>M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Composition.CanvasComposition.CreateDrawingSession(Windows.UI.Composition.CompositionDrawingSurface,Windows.Foundation.Rect,System.Single)</codeEntityReference>.
          All drawing performed through the returned CanvasDrawingSession will be scaled 
          up or down accordingly.
        </para>

      <title>How to test DPI handling</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          The easiest way to test that your app will do the right thing in response to 
          changing display DPI is to run on Windows 10 and change display settings while 
          the app is running:
        </para>
        <list class="bullet">
          <listItem>Right-click on the desktop background and choose 'Display settings'</listItem>
          <listItem>Move the slider labeled 'Change the size of text, apps, and other items'</listItem>
          <listItem>Click the 'Apply' button</listItem>
          <listItem>Choose 'Sign out later'</listItem>
        </list>
        <para>
          If you do not have Windows 10, you can also test with the Windows Simulator. In 
          the Visual Studio toolbar, change the "Local Machine" setting to "Simulator", 
          then use the Change Resolution icon to switch the simulated display between:
        </para>
        <list class="bullet">
          <listItem>100% (DPI=96)</listItem>
          <listItem>140% (DPI=134.4)</listItem>
          <listItem>180% (DPI=172.8)</listItem>
