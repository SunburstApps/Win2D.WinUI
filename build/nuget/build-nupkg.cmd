REM
REM Version is read from the VERSION file.
REM
REM Command-line parameter specifies optionally "signed",
REM followed by an optional prerelease string to append to the version.
REM
REM Say VERSION contains "0.0.3" then:
REM
REM build-nupkg                     <-- generates package with version 0.0.3
REM build-nupkg build-140912-1100   <-- generates package with version 0.0.3-build-140912-1100
REM
REM The "signed" flag is intended for internal Microsoft use. This generates a
REM package without a prerelease version number, using a license agreement
REM associated with Microsoft releasing pre-built binaries, and pulling the
REM binaries from a different location to usual. This script does not actually
REM perform signing: the expectation is that previous tooling has already
REM signed the files and copied them to the right place for it to pick up.
